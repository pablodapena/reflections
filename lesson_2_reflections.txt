##What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need it?##
When we initialize a repository we are starting a new branch that can later be
tracked. it is needed to be able to eventually track it in git.
##How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?##
The staging area works as a middle ground between the working directory and the
repository.It could be valuable in that we might not want to commit all files
at once.
