tracked. it is needed to be able to eventually track it in git.
##How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?##
The staging area works as a middle ground between the working directory and the
repository.It could be valuable in that we might not want to commit all files
at once.
##How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?##
You can use it to have it as a place to hold certain files before actually committing
them.
##What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized?How would branches help?##
Branches would be helpful when we are trying to add features but do not want to
mess with the master branch##
