##How did a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?##
It gave me a visual output that showed me the only differences in the big js file.
It was a lot easier to navigate throught it than having to go through a 1000+ line
essay.
##How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient
programmer in the long term?##
It can help us by showing us the changes in the code. Maybe when we started we
were not that good of programmers but as time goes by and we keep practicing
our code should reflect all the new things we have learnt.
##What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit,like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
doc does?/##
The pros of being able to do the commits manually in Git is that it gives us
the power to save the document when we feel it is ready to be saved.If it was
saved automatically it would save several versions, a lot of those with code that
is not finished and/or code that we do not want to say just yet.
##Why do you think some version control systems, like Git,allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?##
Git allows to save multiple files in one commit because it's a software developer
tool. Some programs have separate files that form one program so it makes sense
to save several files at once.
##How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?##
the git log command allows you to see all the versions saved with the message
explaining what each commit is for, the git diff command allows you to see
the changes made between two commits
##How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?##
Version control allows us to save multiple versions of our projects so if for
some reason we add or remove a line of code that will break our code, we can always
revert to the previous version that ran perfectly, that is assuming that we saved.
##How do you want to use Git?##
I would like to start by being able track the notes I'm gonna be taking with Git
